Bill Gates Seems Evil


Ronald Reagan didn’t say the word<br> 
  AIDS. He said<br> 
people can’t sue corporations for vaccine.<br>  
  damages.<br> 
Now Trump is slashing all the red tape,<br> 
etc.,<br>   
and Bill Gates is involved.  

Bill Gates doesn’t trust nature at all.
He has a technology
that makes everyone the same.
He was the person
who did Event 201.

Google it. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates
wants to make human-implantable
  capsules
which can show who has been vaccinated
against the coronavirus.

He hates vitamin C.
Don’t take any vitamin C
in case it doesn’t help at all.
Don’t touch your face.

Mandatory quarantine
for visitors to Hawaii.
Mandatory virtual book club.
Mandatory virtual happy hour.

The thing about owls and larks
not being on Netflix and not tweeting
and not being on Facebook or Instagram.
