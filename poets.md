**Self-Portrait as Masturbator**

Come—swim in me, tread<br>
upon shores of cenotes<br>
unburied. In the<br>

water is a sheep<br>
led by the horns, a hand there,<br>
white-knuckled, grasping,<br>

but it’s you blinking<br>
through her slow lashes. You had<br>
convinced yourself (or<br>

were convinced) that Out<br>
There is where Fear lives, walking<br>
in a body not<br>

your own & if you<br>
kept your head down you might not<br>
meet its hollow mouth<br>

skimming over your<br>
smooth surfaces. It’s smaller<br>
than you’d imagined—<br>

the red curve where God’s<br>
knife sliced through trying to draw<br>
the perfect circle.<br>

You are the head that<br>
emerges on the other<br>
side of love, the eye<br>

of a thousand lids<br>
opening, searching, ***I’ve<br>
arrived, I’ve arrived***—<br>

**Bill Gates Seems Evil**


Ronald Reagan didn’t say the word<br> 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;AIDS. He said<br> 
people can’t sue corporations for vaccine.  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;damages.<br> 
Now Trump is slashing all the red tape,<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;etc.,  
and Bill Gates is involved.<br> 

Bill Gates doesn’t trust nature at all.<br>
He has a technology<br>
that makes everyone the same.<br>
He was the person<br>
who did Event 201.<br>

Google it. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates<br>
wants to make human-implantable<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp;capsules<br>
which can show who has been vaccinated<br>
against the coronavirus.<br>

He hates vitamin C.<br>
Don’t take any vitamin C<br>
in case it doesn’t help at all.<br>
Don’t touch your face.<br>

Mandatory quarantine<br>
for visitors to Hawaii.<br>
Mandatory virtual book club.<br>
Mandatory virtual happy hour.<br>

The thing about owls and larks<br>
not being on Netflix and not tweeting<br>
and not being on Facebook or Instagram.

**Fricatives**


To speak English properly, Mrs. Lee said, you must learn<br> 
the difference between three and free. Three men<br> 
escaped from Alcatraz in a rubber raft and drowned<br> 
on their way to Angel Island. Hear the difference? Try<br> 
this: you fought your way into existence. Better. Look<br> 
at this picture. Fresh yellow grains beaten<br> 
till their seeds spill. That’s threshing. That’s<br> 
submission. You must learn to submit<br> 
before you can learn. You must be given<br> 
a voice before you can speak. Nobody wants to listen<br> 
to a spectacled boy with a Hong Kong accent.<br> 
You will have to leave this city, these dark furrows<br> 
stuffed full with ancestral bones. Know<br> 
that death is thorough. You will speak of bruised bodies<br> 
skinnier than yours, force the pen past batons<br> 
and blood, call it fresh material for writing. Now<br> 
they’re paying attention. You’re lucky enough<br> 
to care about how the tongue moves, the seven types<br> 
of fricatives, the articulatory function of teeth<br> 
sans survival. You will receive a good education<br> 
abroad and make your parents proud. You will take<br> 
a stranger’s cock in your mouth in the piss-slick stall<br> 
of that dingy Cantonese restaurant you love and taste<br> 
where you came from, what you were made of all along.<br> 
Put some work into it, he growls. C’mon, give me<br> 
some bite. Your mother visits one October, tells you<br> 
how everyone speaks differently here, more proper.<br> 
You smile, nod, bring her to your favourite restaurant,<br> 
order dim sum in English. They’re releasing<br> 
the students arrested five years ago. Just a tad more<br> 
soy sauce please, thank you. The television replays<br> 
yesterday on repeat. The teapots are refilled. You spoon<br> 
served rice into your mouth, this perfect rice.<br> 
Steamed, perfect, white.<br>

**A Little Closer to the Edge**

Young enough to believe nothing<br>
will change them, they step, hand-in-hand,<br>

into the bomb crater. The night full<br>
of  black teeth. His faux Rolex, weeks<br>

from shattering against her cheek, now dims<br>
like a miniature moon behind her hair.<br>

In this version the snake is headless — stilled<br>
like a cord unraveled from the lovers’ ankles.<br>

He lifts her white cotton skirt, revealing<br>
another hour. His hand. His hands. The syllables<br>

inside them. O father, O foreshadow, press<br>
into her — as the field shreds itself<br>

with cricket cries. Show me how ruin makes a home<br>
out of  hip bones. O mother,<br>

O minutehand, teach me<br>
how to hold a man the way thirst<br>

holds water. Let every river envy<br>
our mouths. Let every kiss hit the body<br>

like a season. Where apples thunder<br>
the earth with red hooves. & I am your son.

**Ma Heling in Fact**

In fact she’s a person waiting for death<br>

the way hundreds of people do in this village.<br>

In fact her husband is one already dead<br>

just like all the other dead persons in this village.<br>

In fact she hasn’t reconciled herself to dying in that way.<br>

In fact she remarried less than a year after her husband’s death.<br>

In fact the man who married her also had a newly dead wife.<br>

In fact Ma Heling, now in her fifties,<br>

still looks plump and handsome.<br>

In fact she’s got AIDS that has started to affect her.<br>

In fact there are hundreds of people waiting for death like her.<br>

In fact the man who married her was a normal healthy guy.<br>

In fact this guy had no choice but to marry an AIDS victim<br>

if he still wanted a woman.<br>

In fact it’s impossible for any healthy woman to marry<br>

a man whose wife has just died of AIDS.<br>

In fact death has ___set___tled down in this village,<br>

collecting people without even giving notice.<br>

In fact the village is done for, dying out.<br>

In fact they are still alive.<br>

In fact they have to live until they die.<br>

In fact they have to do some living things before their death.<br>

In fact the man who married her really wanted to marry her,<br>

for he, in his prime, needed a woman; even though she,<br>

in fact useless, could only sit there or<br>

walk slowly with her hands tucked in her sleeves,<br>

he still wanted to marry her.<br>

In fact this woman can still spread her legs in bed.<br>

In fact this woman still has plenty of flesh.<br>

He does wish she’d never die so that every night<br>

there would be a living woman lying in his bed.<br>

In fact the village distributes condoms to every family.<br>

In fact the man who married her never uses condoms.<br>

In fact she once asked, Aren’t you afraid of getting infected Aren’t you<br>

afraid of death?<br>

In fact he is afraid of death,<br>

while in fact he still doesn’t use condoms,<br>

doesn’t think he’ll be so unfortunate, in fact in their village<br>

almost all the men of his age have been unfortunate<br>

but in fact they got infected by selling blood, in fact<br>

the man who married her has never heard of anyone falling ill by fucking his wife.<br>

In fact, to a peasant, fucking one’s wife with a rubber sheath –<br>

that sounds in fact more fucking incredible than death.<br>

<br>
