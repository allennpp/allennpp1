**Bill Gates Seems Evil**


Ronald Reagan didn’t say the word<br> 
  AIDS. He said<br> 
people can’t sue corporations for vaccine.<br>  
  damages.<br> 
Now Trump is slashing all the red tape,<br> 
etc.,<br>   
and Bill Gates is involved.<br>  

Bill Gates doesn’t trust nature at all.<br>
He has a technology<br>
that makes everyone the same.<br>
He was the person<br>
who did Event 201.<br>

Google it. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates<br>
wants to make human-implantable<br>
  capsules<br>
which can show who has been vaccinated<br>
against the coronavirus.<br>

He hates vitamin C.<br>
Don’t take any vitamin C<br>
in case it doesn’t help at all.<br>
Don’t touch your face.<br>

Mandatory quarantine<br>
for visitors to Hawaii.<br>
Mandatory virtual book club.<br>
Mandatory virtual happy hour.<br>

The thing about owls and larks<br>
not being on Netflix and not tweeting<br>
and not being on Facebook or Instagram.
