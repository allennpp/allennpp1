title: Aftersun or the impossible care 
---

![Aftersun](/images/Aftersun1.png)

A father and his daughter are going on vacation meanwhile each one is going through different and definitive moments in their lives. 
The desire to give a good time is repeated in many scenes, and both want the other to feel good, but at times, perhaps unconsciously, 
the misunderstanding of their life times makes a constant tension throughout the film, a knot that gets tighter and tighter but does not break.

The daughter's character, 11-year-old, Sofi, is about to reach puberty and looks with curiosity at the teenagers who are also at this resort
in Turkey. At times they integrate her into the group and it seems that she longs to become one of them at some point. Sofi is recording with
a video camera the moments she spends with her father between questions and games in the room. Those recordings are events that are mixed 
with Sofi's memory. 

The father, Calum, on the eve of his 31st birthday, tries to give his daughter and himself a precious moment, 
but that is curtailed by something bigger. It is known that he is a young father, even, in one scene, 
the teenagers told him that he looks like her daughter's brother. It is known that he is separated from his couple, 
because she is not with them on holidays. It is known that he cannot afford the full resort plan 
because Sofi does not have the handle that other young people have to have access to unlimited food and drinks; 
and he also is interested in Tai Chi.

The relationship between these two characters is interwoven between the company and abandonment, 
between the dance’s nearby and the sea's loneliness. There is a scene where the daughter -Sofi- invites her father, 
Calum, to sing, but he rejects her. She decides to go alone and sing the song while her father watches her,
she hopes that he will join the song  (and as a spectator one hopes that she will stop singing in some way); 
but no, everyone stands unwaved, and she finishes the song, he leaves the place and his daughter; but in the middle of everything 
there coexist a mutual-sincere affection. It seems that in the midst of the misunderstanding of each one by the other, 
which is also seen in the projected colors on each character, there is a trust and sincerity in the shared feelings. 

Aftersun presents two moments that at the same time are moments in the future. Sofi's camera serves as a tool for remembering, 
and that same camera is sometimes also used by Sofi's father. 
She doesn't really know what these moments will mean, only until she reaches the age her father was on the trip.

The future is also the present, Sofi's present, which has memories and moments that are filled with film material. 
The facts, memories and feelings come together in a journey that would mark the life of the two characters. 
It is not really known to what extent these memories are distorted by Sofi, but the moments live in an indeterminate space in which the father dances,
something he likes to do in the middle of his situation. The dance that is only clearly seen at the end of the film shows two latent realities,
debauchery, ecstasy and disorientation in the middle of a party, scenes that appear sometimes throughout the film.

Aftersun is not only the look of the girl traveling next to her father, but also the look of the father through his daughter’s eyes, 
and all the efforts to maintain a relationship (im)possible. The film takes place in the unsaid, that's the most valuable thing. 
There is no plot twist or big bifurcating event in the images, but it is possible to glimpse in the details. The unsaid, the not obvious, 
the place where words are left over. The film takes place in the past in memories of the present that in the end are an embrace. 
The kind and desperate embrace, the non-existent space, the equality between father and daughter in the last memory 
of a dance as affectionate as painful while “Under Pressure” by Queen and David Bowie plays. So, throughout the film the daughter 
becomes a father and the father also becomes vulnerable as his daughter, there is an agreement of immaculate care, affection and 
sincerity while Sofi sings her father's birthday along with more tourists but he does not get excited.

Aftersun is the greatest example of a fatherhood that does not need to be overcome or abolished for the realization of children, 
but it is a fatherhood under the light of a girl who looks at her father on cassettes from a camera that her father also 
carries with him until the end.

**CAMINO INTERIOR**<br>

Lo he hecho todo<br>
sembré un árbol donde no recuerdo <br>
escribí un libro que nadie ha leído<br>
y tengo un hijo que nunca veo.<br>

Lo he llorado todo<br>
he llorado la muerte el amor el destino<br>
la miseria el hambre la distancia<br>
y ya no queda sal en ninguna lágrima.<br>


Acaso al fin lo he escrito todo<br>
mil quinientos setenta y nueve poemas con treinta<br>
y un centavos<br>
tres cuentos dos ensayos<br>
noventa y tres informes<br>
una renuncia<br>
siete cartas  <br>

<br>once mensajes en la nevera


tres mentiras<br>
cuatro grafittis <br>
setecientas trece firmas –incluida la renuncia–.<br>


Un árbol un hijo un libro<br>
un destino un amor una muerte<br>
un hastío un dolor una cólera<br>
  <br> he escrito todo mi desamparo.* <br>

***Hellman Pardo***<br>
